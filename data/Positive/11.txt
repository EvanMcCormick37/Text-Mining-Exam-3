I recieved this bow earlier this week and I love it. It's the first bow I can call my own, so I'm not sure how it holds up to more experienced archer's standards, but I'm loving it. I did purchase a bow stringer at the same time, but besides that, this comes with everything you need. I recieved the bow in three pieces with fasteners, a hex wrench for assembly, a string, an arrow rest, and even a bow bag.

The only thing I am not sure about is that the bow bag is meant for the bow to be stored disassembled, in three pieces. I'm not a fan of the idea of disassembling my bow freqently enough to get use out of the bag, not only for the inconvenience, but also because I am concerned about fatiguing the bolts. It's a really nice bag, though, so I hope I can find some use for it. And since the item description does not mention it, I don't feel it deserves to be knocked down any points.

Overall, I am very happy with this bow. I may have to get some kind of simple sight for it, as I am currently playing a bit of a guessing game as to where the arrow will go, but the handle has several tapped holes that function as potential mounting holes for it. So far, this bow is a 10/10.
