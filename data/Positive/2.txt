This is a great bow folks, I've been shooting for over 30 years. my wife bought me this for a bowfishing bow, since it has all the mounting options already on it. I've owned many bows several high end pricey ones, this is a all around awesome bow! I got the 50lb one I've had it so far for 2 days and shot the heck out of it. I recommend this bow big time. if your new to archery look up videos on setting up a take down recurve and read instructions that comes with the bow. Hardest part for me was figuring out top limb from bottom limb, I would recommend to company to put a simple A and B sticker on it to make it easier to figure out. this was my first take down bow I usually shoot one peice recurves but I got it togather no problem in a few mins out of the box. great bow, nice bag comes with a stringer the bow string is ok, nuff to shoot for a good while. I tossed the arrow rest and put on a felt pad since I shoot off the riser all in all 5 stars get it! Get it now!
