I'm just starting out in archery, so I can't do a comparison-type review... All I can say is, if you're an experienced archer, you're probably not even looking at a bow for under $100. If you're a newbie like me, I think you'll like it a lot.
I believe 1 or more previous reviews said it didn't come with a string or arrow rest. It does come with both. It also comes with a tote bag to carry it (taken down). I didn't get a chance to try the arrow rest, my girl-dog decided it was a chew-toy before I got a chance to mount it. Shooting off the shelf is no problem. I currently use a Whisker Biscuit. It comes pre-drilled and threaded to mount a variety of arrow rests. Other pre-drilled holes are threaded and aligned to mount a bow quiver or sight. I've mounted both.
The long & short of it... It shoots just fine as-is, but, it is also quite up-gradable. It is well worth the money.
