Bought this for my husband. He had been out of archery for over 20 years and wanted to get back into it, and maybe do some small game hunting, while keeping it inexpensive and simple.

I bought him the 30# bow and ordered him the sight, arrows, and accessories he wanted. Per husband:

The bow was very easy to assemble. If your a beginner, you will need to follow the directions carefully to make sure you have the upper and lower limbs in the correct positions, and the bow strung properly. If your a beginner, or have been out of it a while, it's worth the time and effort to watch a few videos on how to set up the bow properly so that it shoots well.

After about an hour of setting up and adjusting the bow and sights, he was shooting a 6 inch group at 20 yards with a big smile on his face.
