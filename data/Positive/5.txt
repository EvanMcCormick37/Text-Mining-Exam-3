I got an amazing deal on this one with a $10 discount promo which is the reason I purchased it. I'm really enjoying this bow and it works very well. For those who are complaining about no manual, it's in the gallery of this listing. Those who are familiar with takedown recurves shouldn't need the manual and already know how to set one up.

# Pros
- Take down works great.
- Great price for a very well made bow.
- Standard tapped locations for sights, arrow rest, and front stabilizer. Some folks mentioned "no area to install a sight", either they changed the design and have added them since or those customers have no idea that it's there already.
- Metal riser is well made and has rubber grips.
- Limbs are built well and mine came all black without the logo.

# Cons
- None.

# Would like to see
- Include the print out manual from the listing gallery so customers don't complain about not getting a manual. This really isn't an issue for me since I already knew what to expect however it's a con for TopArchery since customers are going to troll and write negative reviews.
- Include a bow stringer. Again, not an issue for me since I already have one.

# Notes
- I got the 50# and it's awesome. I think I like the 50# recurve better than my 55# compound. It's a toss up. Always take 2 bows on a hunting trip. The recurve is easy to restring so if by chance something like a broad head slices the string, it can easily be restrung. Great additional bow just in case the compound fails.
- I might get the 40# since I really like this bow.
- The 1x thick plastic washer that people have mentioned seems to not be used for this setup. Not sure why it's included. Based on the manual (gallery photo) it's not displayed in step 1.
- I've attached photos of my setup.
