My bow arrived in pristine condition. Stringing it with a bow stringer insures that I won’t get any limb twisting or warping. Chrono gives me an average out of 10 shots of 172fps on a 10GPP arrow with the 50# model. I don’t like that the logo is printed on both limbs. This was purchased for hunting, so I’ll be painting black over that. Overall, a very nice bow for the price point. This bow shoots and behaves very much like my Samick Discovery recurve, just 5-10fps slower. Very very similar to the Mandarin Duck Phantom. I got the 3 year amazon sports warranty just in case, but I’ll definitely update this review if something goes wrong with the limbs. For now, she shoots straight and clean. Very little stacking at 50 pounds, but I am an avid powerlifter and don’t really feel the weight too much so I may not be a good point of view on that. All in all, this is probably the best value for a bow that I have ever seen. There are all of the standard bushings and holes for bolting on accessories. It’s light in the hand and the compound style grip is easy to get used to. It feels good in the hand and has surprisingly little hand shock. I wouldn’t mind making it my main bow. I bought it as a backup for hunting trips but I’m shooting it as my main target practice bow simply to break it in and test its durability, and also because it’s just a good bow. I’ll update in a few months or if something goes wrong.
