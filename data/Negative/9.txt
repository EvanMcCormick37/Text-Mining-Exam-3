Purchased this bow for my Son so he could practice in our backyard, (so he doesn't use my hunting bows). I've owned many different bows during my youth and currently have 3 other bows. Very disappointed with the limbs on this bow. The upper limb has uneven tension causing the limb to twist after release. Purchased another bow at Sportsman's guide. Could not recommend this bow!
