Really cool survival bow. I started archery and bow hunting over a decade ago and decided I want to switch from compound to recurve for fun and the additional challenge, plus the survivalist benefit.

This bow is easy to assemble and easy to string if you’ve chosen an appropriate draw weight for your strength. The really cheap plastic arrow rest was hard to screw in and broke the 2nd arrow I shot. The bowstring broke after 8 or 9 arrows.

I don’t see a replace option or a way to message seller so I’m returning and reordering for a now higher price. Bow is a good value even with the cheap arrow rest as I wouldn’t have replaced it anyway. I will probably increase my rating if the second bow (string) holds up better.
