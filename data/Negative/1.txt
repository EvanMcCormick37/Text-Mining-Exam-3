Being an American Indian I have more than a few bows. After having a massive heart attack and then heart surgery, my children thought they would purchase this bow to cheer me up. I opened the package and put the bow together then discovered that the bottom half had a twist in it. It was so bad that when you put the string on it, it fly's around to the back side. I tried contacting the company but there is no phone number or address to reach these people. Maybe this is just a fluke but any company that has no way to reach them is not worth a hill of beans in my book. I would recomend that you look at another business to purchase your bow. Thank you for reading this and I hope it helps.
