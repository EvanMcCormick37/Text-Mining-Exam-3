I took my new bow out for the first time to go shooting with my daughter since she had gotten a new children's bow set for her birthday. I followed the directions for installing the limbs and bow string and had no problems that first day. The second time we went to shoot the top limb split in the middle which made the bowstring snap off the lower limb of the bow ultimately making the bow useless. I had shot maybe 50 arrows through it altogether and I now have a useless bow.
