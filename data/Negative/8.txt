I have had this bow since April but only shot it a handful of times. Set it up yesterday to shoot and the string kicked past the top limb and smacked my fore arm on the first shot. I reinstalled the string and noticed the limb is twisted. I’m sure this not normal. Can’t figure out a way to get in contact with the manufacturer and from the looks of reviews others have had the same issue.
