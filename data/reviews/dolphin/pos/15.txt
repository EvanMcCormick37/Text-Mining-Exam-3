This product works well. I use the nano filters and it does a good job of picking up the sand in my pool. My only dislike is changing to the bag filter. I only wish that I would not have to screw or unscrew the white mesh cover to use with the bag. Either it should not require the mesh cover or at least make it snap in for ease of use. I am still giving this product a 5 star review because it does such a good job and is very user friendly. Just put it in the pool and turn it on and go do other things. It automatically turns off in 3 hours and you can take it out when you are ready.
