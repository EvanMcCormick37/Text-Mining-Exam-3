I bought the dolphin premiere a year ago after researching every brand and model. I have a 29,000 gallon in ground pool, 36’ x 18’, 8 ft deep. The dolphin has been stellar. I love that it has 3 filters to choose from because we get a lot of tree debris in the pool during spring and fall. The bag attachment has been amazing at picking up the leaves and I don’t need to stop and empty it. I use the medium or fine filter cartridges otherwise when not dealing with leaves. Even the medium filter cartridges picks up a good amount of leaves. It takes 3 hours for it to clean the pool, it’s never gotten stuck. I use it almost daily and it’s kept the pool so clean. We used to use a pool service but the pool was often dirty because they only came out once a week. So the dolphin has been amazing because I can run it daily. I take it out after it’s done, every time, and rinse out the filter cartridges. I have 2 complaints and that is the quality of the storage dolly isn’t great although it hasn’t failed on me. And I also find it difficult to wrap the cord up and attach it to the storage dolly because it very stiff and resistant to being looped up (although that’s why it works well in the water and doesn’t knot up). But aside from that I’m very pleased with my purchase and it was well worth the money.
