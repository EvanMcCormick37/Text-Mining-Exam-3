Back history, when we bought the house, it came with a pool. We hired a local company that would come out once a week and clean the pool and adjust the chemicals as necessary. They did an ok job until they changed the kid that normally came out and put him on a different route. They also raised our rates and at the last time we used them, we were paying close to 200 per month to simply have someone come out and do a moderate cleaning. If the day our cleaning fell on a holiday, they skipped us but continued to be paid full rates.

We canceled this service and tried several others to no avail. Without trusting a company to do this, I elected to do so and had been for the last year or so. This gets old fast, especially when you work 12 to 14-hour work days. I researched pool cleaners and my wife bought the cheapest one on Amazon and we quickly returned it. I researched this one and thought to give it a try. Was it one of the most expensive if not the most expensive on here for my pool - yes. I can tell you honestly that I have never wanted to write a review more than this one. This product FLAT OUT is the best product I have ever purchased. In the first cleaning, it climbed all my walls and scrubbed them and the bottom of my pool has never been this clean. I am blown away with this pool cleaner. I regret spending 200 per month for years on mediocre service when I could have bought this one time and saved thousands. Dont used a pool service, buy this and add the chemicals yourself.
