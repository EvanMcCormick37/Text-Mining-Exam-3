Over 20 years I've purchased at least 3 Dolphins, diagnostic, etc, and they clean great, and for about half what I spent on the Premier, they all died after 3-4 years. Maytronics warranty policy is a joke due to shipping, but here's a tip, if the impeller seizes it will move forward a bit, then shut down. Check for hair around the shaft, use pliers to free it up, whatever it takes, but don't assume the worst if it acts up. Time will tell if this is a better design, it seems like it with the filter since the others were all thick bag types (which filter better than this but suck to clean) and yes this comes with a bag and a couple of cartridge options, but the bag is more like the green cleanup bag, not the heavy ones I have 3 of, which won't fit this, thanks Maytronics!
If your taken in by the second set of cartridge filters, the course ones, don't be, it's not great, use the bag. This is the most nimble Dolphin I've owned, it turns effectively and improves coverage I guess.
One thing I'm confused about is if this is "The newest innovative culmination of all we've learned..." why I see online people reviewed it many years ago?
Oh, and I owned one aquabot turbo, wow they are useless and slow by comparison, but durable I guess...
