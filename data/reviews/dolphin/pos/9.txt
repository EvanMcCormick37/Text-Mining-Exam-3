I just replaced the last one—identical model after 10 years of once-weekly use. Never a lick of trouble, never even replaced the filter elements.
I’ve tried them all over the past 30 years — kreepy, Polaris, in-ground hokey built in jets, another robot brand, hand vacuum, and professional pool service. This easily beat them all. I assume the latest iteration will be as reliable (looks and functions identical) as my original. A bit pricey but pools are expensive and in the long run more than worth it. I got the caddy with the last one and highly recommend it. I just store it outside in the shade.
