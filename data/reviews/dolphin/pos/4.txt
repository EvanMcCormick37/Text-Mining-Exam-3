I recently purchased the Dolphin Premier and I have observed it while it cleaned my inground pool. My pool is 16 x32 with 4 ft. at the shallow end to 8 ft. at the deep end. I have 2 shelves on each side of the pool, that said let's get to performance. The cleaner was easy to set up, no problems there. I dropped it into the pool and it was off. This cleaner really can climb the side of your pool to the water edge, amazing to watch really it goes along the top water edge and cleans the water line great. The cable never got tangled, which was a concern for me. My pool has a problem with yellow algae but the cleaner got rid of this first go around. Yes, I know this cleaner is expensive, the price is my only gripe, but as I stated you get what you pay for and I believe now that the money was well spent. No more scraping down the side of my pool and cleaning the bottom. The fact that it has a 3 year coverage is a plus also. This is a efficient, well made cleaner and If you can get past the price tag I highly recommend it . Update: 3/28/24, I have had this pool cleaner for almost a year and it has survived in my pool through a harsh Texas summer and mild winter. Everything is working excellent as described. I have never had any problems with this cleaner and performs perfectly. As I said before you get what you pay for and it has been worth every penny spent!
