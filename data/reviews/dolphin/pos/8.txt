We purchased a rechargeable robotic cleaner last year. It did ok for less than three months. Wasn’t the answer. Last week we did what can only be what we should have done.
This thing is awesome. So sorry I didn’t take a before picture. The live oak next to our pool drops so many leaves that it makes a mess every year. The job that the Dolphin does is truly remarkable. When we clean the bag and find what it picks up? Well it’s crazy. If it would jump in the hot tub part of the pool it would be perfect. I could go on but why? It’s the best we have had in our thirty five years of owning a pool.
Easy to use and I would recommend getting the caddy for it.
