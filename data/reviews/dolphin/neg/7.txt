I finally broke down and replaced the old pump operated Polaris. The unit itself seems sturdy, the control box is very cheaply made. The line cable seemed sturdy. I have a 36 x 24 gunite in ground rectangular volleyball pool. The deepest place is in the middle and gradually slopes to each side from 5.5 ft to about 3.5 feet. The robot did a great job of cleaning one side of the pool except for the corners. No matter where I set up the box or placed the robot, it generally would make one or two passes and then head for the far side of the pool. It cleaned exactly half the pool. I called tech support the following Monday. They were nice, but not pool experts. They were a call center reading off a list. They finally recommended I return the unit to Amazon. I am trying to decide to go a Polaris or some other type of cleaner.
Very disappointing.
