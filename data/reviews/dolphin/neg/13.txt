The worse purchase I have ever done. Like it is written on the other reviews of one star that piece of crab does not climb the walls and very sparingly clean the bottom. Waranty is non exixtente with Maytronics, it's just a joke and the same with the seller Terra Direct. They just take the money and run. $1400 !!! Never I will do a purchase of a value more that $100 on Amazon : much too risky. Please stay away from Maytronics and Terra Direct.
