I purchased this in 2020 after manually vacuuming for a few years. It was amazing. It comes with a fine filter (sand, dirt, etc.) and a bag for leaves. It was very easy to clean and the robot cleaned the pool well beyond my expectations. After a year, that’s when things started to go downhill.

I have a medium sized (14k gallon) pool and used the vacuum regularly.
I noticed the vacuum was starting but not moving so I took it to Leslie’s pool and the warranty covered the cost of repair.
So, we were back to our honeymoon phase right? WRONG.
Fast forward to 2023, vacuum would turn on, go reverse, then float up. I took it back for repair and the cost was about $600 since the warranty was out.

If you’re okay with having an amazing product for a couple of years, then this is for you!

Speaking from my experience, If you want something with longevity, this is just not it.
