I purchased a dolphin premier robot in March of 2022 ($1247.00). Not only has it stopped working altogether, but the plastic coating on the electrical line has been flaking off into the pool. This should not be happening and seems like a product defect. To me it is not only dangerous to the pool system, but more importantly, if small children were to swim in the pool and touch the line, bits of plastic will be floating around in your pool and could possibly be ingested. Not only children, but basically anyone that swims in the pool could run this risk. I don't know what it is made of, but the quantity of the material flaking off seems extremely hazardous. I have contacted the company and I am waiting a response.
