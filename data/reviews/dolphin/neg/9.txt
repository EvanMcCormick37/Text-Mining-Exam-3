I watched the reviews, and was very excited about this product. I had a previous Dolphin pool cleaner that worked great for years, but finally stopped working. It seemed every video and reviews showed this was the best all tested, so I purchased it. First issue I had it would not leave the deep end of the pool. I called tech support, and they gave me a few solutions (That Never Worked) Second problem my Dolphin would not climb up the walls which my older model did. Third my Dolphin would roll over a layer of debris and not pickup even 50% as maybe it had no suction...(.Yes I always kept the filters clean). So on the last day to return the product I did. I had great expectations, but was frustrated by my Dolphin. Would I purchase another Dolphin Product YES, but I would like to see it in use in my pool first.
