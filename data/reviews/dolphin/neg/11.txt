Unit didn't work straight out of the box. Called customer support. Got the call center in the Philippines. Wouldn't answer any questions. Refused to get the supervisor on the phone. In the end got no help at all. Best option was to simply return the robot and get something else from someone else. Never got connected to technical support or a supervisor. They were completely obstructionist and just wanted to send me everything by email for asynchronous help. Worst customer service possible.
