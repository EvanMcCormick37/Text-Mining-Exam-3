We purchased this cleaner to replace a Nautilus cleaner that is run by a turbo pump. The Nautilus often has a great deal of difficulty in cleaning the whole pool due to its simple mechanical components.

I was excited to test out a more advanced system of the Dolphin, and put it to work cleaning up some fall debris the day it was delivered. I watched it for a few minutes in delight as it quickly picked up leaves and small sticks before returning inside.

After an hour or so, I returned outside to check on the Dolphin’s progress, I watched it climb the wall of the pool to clean the waterline, and heard an audible squeaking of rubber on vinyl. I watched the “powerful, dual scrubbing brushes attack” the vinyl liner of my pool and attempt to pull it loose. (see picture)

I immediately stopped the Dolphin and inspected the pool to find bunching in several other areas. I contacted our pool service company, and they informed us that the liner has been damaged and will need to be replaced as soon as possible.

I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLEANER IF YOU HAVE A VINYL LINER IN YOUR POOL! DO NOT BELIEVE THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION THAT SAYS IT WORKS WITH A VINYL POOL TYPE!
