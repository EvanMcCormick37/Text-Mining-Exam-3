Our robot vacuum broke after 1 season of use, although it sounds like it’s covered under warranty, no local pool store will service it bc it wasn’t purchased through them. I now have to pack up and mail this vacuum to maytronics and pay for shipping which was $75 and wait about 3 weeks for it to be (hopefully) fixed and returned to me. Very disappointed.
