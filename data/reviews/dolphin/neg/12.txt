Finally decided to bite the bullet and invest in a pool cleaning robot. I spent a very long time reading reviews and researching different options and decided on this one. It was on the higher side of my budget but I decided it was worth investing more money into hoping I'd get something that worked well that would last me a long time. The first month or so it seemed like it did a pretty good job. I would still have to spot clean a few areas after a cleaning cycle that it struggled to get to but I had accepted that and I was mostlycontent with the purchase until I went to go use it today not even 2 month after I purchased it. I started a cleaning cycle and when I came back later on one of the cleaning wheels was off along with the bar that it attaches to. I pulled it out and investigated what was going on and discovered this little plastic track that held the wheel in place snapped causing the entire track system to fall apart. I attempted to try and put it all back together and re-situate the wheel back into the track it sits in but the second I tried turning it back on and it immediately just popped back out of place causing it to fall apart all over again.
