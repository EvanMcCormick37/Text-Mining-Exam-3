The brushes on this unit do not seem to be hitting the bottom of the pool, there's two lines where the foam pads make contact but the middle is still pretty dirty when the robot passes by, they dont seem to be getting proper contsct with the surface. The cleaning program appears very random and insufficiently covers our pool. We ran the unit 4x before it seemed to get most of the bottom of the pool. It never climbed the walls and there's a distinct dirt line where it stops approximately 1ft below the water line in the shallow and 2-3ft below the water line in the deep end. I think the worst part was when I called customer service for technical support and my only options were to read through a useless pamphlet on tips & tricks or return the robot with ZERO support provided for this $1400 robot. I returned it and will never purchase a dolphin product again based on their lack of customer support and highly advise against purchasing this item. I attempted to post photos but just get errors from Amazon, will attempt to post again later.
