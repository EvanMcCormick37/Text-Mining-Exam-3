Used this for about 2 months and put it away stored great inside the house. Went to open the pool full of gunk and of course it's broken. Drive 3 hours to go have it fixed (this is 2x mind you - once to drop it off and once back. So i've now wasted 12 hours driving) as no one around here takes this brand ofc. Go to pick it up after they allegedly replace a broken MOTOR (after 2 months of usage). Go to put it in the pool and it's still broken.

Now I have to send it back all the way to Maytronics and not have a $1600 cleaner I bought to open my pool (and most likely for the entire pool season here). Been great to do it buy hand and get all the leaves off the bottom of my pool and have basically 0 options because it's the new pool year. terrible customer service. terrible experience. I will never buy another one of these again. BUY FROM ANY OTHER BRAND THIS HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE. Maytronics this is a nightmare

Matronics save my pool year you've already ruined & send me a new bot and take this one back and fix it yourself for refurb and I'll change this review. Otherwise I've never had such terrible service spending $1600 on a product (especially one of the nicer models) beyond annoyed
