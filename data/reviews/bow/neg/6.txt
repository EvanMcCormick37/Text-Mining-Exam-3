Both top and bottom limbs were twisted so bad the string wouldnt stay on. Seriosly warped. Its a good looking bow - too bad it turned out to be a pos. :(
If your read the instructions it says theres another string with pouches on the end to help you string the bow but it wasnt in the box at all.
How would someone be able to trust this thing in their pack taken down. This would literally be impossible to shoot, let alone hunt with.. Im soooo disappointed!
