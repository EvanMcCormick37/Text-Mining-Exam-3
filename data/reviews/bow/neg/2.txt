First, I own multiple bows both compound and recurve but wanted a cheap beat up bow for keeping in the truck. Wanted to like the bow, it is light and felt well made, and I spent about 30 dollars in a rest stabilizers and better string so was really liking it. But, the bottom limb came twisted, I tried to fix it by heating and twisting, but did not work. The string comes out of the groove when releasing and is throwing the arrow slightly sideways. I just wanted a lower limb but there is no contact seller button or way to get parts as far as I can tell. I am returning the bow since it appears there is no way to fix it. Giving one star as I am out 30â€™dollars in string and accessories that I cannot use now, since I will not be rebuying a bow that has zero seller support.
