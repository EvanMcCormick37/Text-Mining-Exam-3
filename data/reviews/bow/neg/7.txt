The arrow rest broke the first time my son used it. They wrote an email back:
Hello,
According to your description, I guess there are two reasons:
1. Your installation method is wrong, attached is the right instruction.
2. The arrow is the accessory we give to our customers for free, and the quality may not be particularly good.
If you are a professional archer, you may need to buy a better arrow rest.
