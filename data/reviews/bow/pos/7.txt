I had a Tongtu Outdoor Sporting 40 lb i bought three months ago. The upper limb broke off at the riser. So i got this bow instead.

The limbs are are straight and there are string channels at both inner limb tips for the string to reline into, nice touch. The riser and limbs have a even black mat finish. Good look. Its pre-drilled for the standard add ones, sights and arrow rest,
The arrow rest attachment hole was a little ruff. I needed to insert the rest attachment bolt all the way through the riser from the inside to finish tapping the hole all the way through the riser so I could bolt the rest onto the riser from the outside. Other than the limbs fit evenly and securely.

I installed a sight and a after market Wisker. It is a very comfortable bow for me to hold and shoot. Its a very light and well balanced recurve.

It put 60 arrows on whatever spot my eyes are focused on.

Now if it doesn't break on me my archery will be very happy indeed . It just an excellent feeling and shooting bow.

The limb broke because I left it strung for several months- Take the string off after use. It will last a lot longer that way.
