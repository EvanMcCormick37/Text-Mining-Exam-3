I am not use to recurve bows so have to build up the arm strength before being able to shoot at full strength but easier to shoot without tightening the limb screws down all the way & helps build arm strength. I got a bow stringer & watched videos how to assemble with it but someone showed me how to string without the bow stringer so sometimes I use it just so I didn't waste money the stringer for nothing. The arrow rest that comes with it is pretty much crap a flimsy piece of rubber or plastic & hard to keep a arrow on it . I used a whisker biscuit but it makes the arrow shoot off so need to find a good arrow rest for it but the bow itself is great especially for the price. I have only shot a couple of compound bows before this.
