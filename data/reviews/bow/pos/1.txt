My husband wanted this bow. Here’s what he says after getting it tonight:

I like it so far! I read a review where someone said the screws/ threads needed lubrication. I keep white lithium grease and that worked just fine. 

Setup was fine, and there WERE instructions, but they leave much to be desired in terms of language. Photos helped ... some. 

We did figure out the correct top and bottom limbs, which was good. Just a good guess though, ultimately. 

I bought a 50 lb. draw, and thought it felt a bit "easy," just to draw, but it hasn't been that long since this 53 year old deadlifted over 400 lbs. Shooting 50 to 100 practice shots and I will feel it, no doubt. 

One reviewer said they shot from the "shelf" and ignored the arrow guide: I'll likely do that, as I like it low and I learned that way as a kid. Feels "natural" to me. The reviewer said if you need a guide, buy another one: might eventually do that. 

It was dark when it got here today: proof of the pudding when I shoot it tomorrow.

UPDATE: I’ve been on antibiotic for bronchitis, but had to shoot it. Just a few practice arrows, but it shot great. I did decide to go ahead and use the arrow guide: the 50 lb. draw was nothing like shooting my target bow as a kid. PLENTY of shoulder soreness.
