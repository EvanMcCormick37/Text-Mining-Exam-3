Great bow!!! Buy a different arrow rest if you want one, the plastic one made a nice screeching sound when I went to draw my arrows back, perfect for giving your game a head start lol. Could have been the brand of arrows too. After I modified it with a little heat on the top it broke. That's just the arrow rest, and should have nothing to do with your buying decision, I just wanted to mention it. YES it is a really good bow for $100 I'm happy with it. Also I would NOT buy the arrows that amazon recommends with this bow ( black and white Tiger 12pk) I'm not saying that they are not good arrows because they are great arrows but they are a little flimsy and long for the 50lb recurve and cannot shoot off of the riser with those arrows because of the rubber fletching, you need a good arrow rest for these arrows and maybe cut off a couple inchs to stiffen the spine. So yea those arrows are not in tune with this bow, a broadhead will go all over the place. Once I get some different arrows with feather fletching I will be good to go! Thank you
