I have been shooting archery for a very long time now. Having worn out my long bow, and looking for a little change to my arsenal, I researched and purchased this bow. It has met my expectations to every level! For any beginner, I would recommend getting a lower draw back as that will allow you the opportunity to practice before adding poundage. But this bow is amazing! The grip is comfortable, the recurve and limbs are beautiful and the accuracy is as accurate as the shooter. It is a little on the heavier side as compared to other bows, but that is to be expected as the bow has a metal grip. I personally don't mind the little extra weight because the metal means that it wont easily break or be damaged. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product, and highly recommend it to any and all archers looking for a good recurve.
