A very good bow at a very good price. I would trust it in a survival situation and that's the gold standard for me. The grip is comfortable in my hand and the riser is solid. The limbs pair well and the string didn't stretch much after sitting for a day which I also look for. I was able to add a sight and stabilizer thanks to the mounting holes which was why I like aluminum risers. Pick up a magnetic bar arrow rest to replace the stock plastic winged one which works fine but didn't last. After letting loose a gross worth of different manufacturers arrows I didn't have any problems. I got the 50 lbs string and it takes a lot of pull but has some serious snap to it, btw a set of brush buttons are a good idea also. All in all I feel like I got a good deal and would definitely recommend. Also I did get a stringer with mine which I read was not included so a bonus there. A decent storage bag included makes this the best deal for under $100 you could get.
