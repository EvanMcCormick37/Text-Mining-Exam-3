1. What do people who like the bow like about it? What do people who like the dolphin pool cleaner like about it?
2. Conversely, what problems to the people who leave 1-star reviews have with these respective products?
3. Which model will perform the best at classifying the positive and negative reviews?
4. Could a model differentiate the positive/negative reviews if we trained it on the combined bow/dolphin dataset? If so, what linguistic features would it pick up to distinguish the positive and the negative reviews?
5. Could at model differentiate the product being reviewed if we trained it on the entire dataset? Which linquistic features would this model use to distinguish between the different products?
